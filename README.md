# datatables-slider-fieldtype
An example for using the datatables editor with ion Range Slider. 

Options for ion RangeSlider can be set through the options of editor.

The fieldtype is a working example, but requires ionDen's RangeSlider installed; sample code for the editor is provided. In case of questions/updates/better ideas, just give me a notice.
